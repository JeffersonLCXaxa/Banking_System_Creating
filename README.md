## About the project

In this project, I have created a simple banking system capable of:

- Registering users and providing a customized account and agency number;
- Logging into the account;
- Depositing funds;
- Withdrawing funds;
- Checking transaction history; and
- Logging out of the system.

Some rules have been implemented in the algorithm, for example, each user has a limit of:

- Maximum of 3 withdrawals per day;
- Withdrawal limit of $500.00;
- The agency will always be 0001.

The entire system provides a personalized experience for each user from registration to record-keeping in the transaction history.

## Project objectives

The main objective of this project is to solve a problem by offering security and protection for customers' money, allowing them to store it in bank accounts.

Additionally, the bank keeps detailed records of financial transactions, providing users with a complete history of their activities. This way, customers can efficiently track and control their finances.

## Other objectives

To demonstrate my problem-solving ability through the Python language and application development using programming skills with the Visual Studio Code IDE.

## Technologies Used:

    <tr>
        <td>Visual Studio Code</td>
        <td>Python</td>
        <td>Python Library</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>v1.79</td>
        <td>v3.10.9</td>
        <td> pandas</td>

</table>

## Business Problem

Lack of efficient financial control for users, making it difficult to track and manage their personal finances properly.

### Brief Description

Customers face difficulties in efficiently managing their finances due to the lack of a solution that allows detailed tracking of transactions and proper control of their expenses and income, thus compromising their financial well-being.

### Proposed Solution

Develop a platform that provides users with a comprehensive view of their financial activities, including detailed transaction records, expense categorization, analysis of spending patterns, and features to establish financial goals, enabling more efficient financial control and better decision-making.
